<h3> 

Eltz Castle is one of the best places in the whole world! It is a medieval castle in Wierschem, Germany. It is often reffered to as the 'fairytale castle,' and is my dream destination. This castle is about 150 years old, and is a well known tourist attraction. There is still a family living in the castle, and every member is very lucky to have inherited such a rich heritage. There are tours inside the castle from time to time, so that others can also see this castle, which anyone fair is unable to describe.
